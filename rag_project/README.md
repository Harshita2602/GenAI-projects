# RAG Project
This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) piepline** built for learning urposes in Generative AI.

## Overview
- Document Ingestion and Processing
- Vector embedding for semantic search
- LLM-based answer generation using retrieved context
- Designed to understand end-to-end RAG workflow

## Tech Stack
-Python
-Langchain
-Vector Database
-LLM API (replace API key before running)

## Learning Outcome
-Understanding of RAG piepline from ingestion to response.
-Integration of embeddings with LLMs.
-Contextual question answering

## Notes
This project is part of my learning journey in Generative AI.
Sensitive information such as API keys has been removed. Replace them with your own keys to run the code.
